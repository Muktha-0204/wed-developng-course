<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
   In my last job, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work.
  For example, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to improve the quality of our photos and graphics. I soon became the
   go-to person for any design needs.</p>

<p>I am a natural leader. I have eventually been promoted to a leadership role in almost every job because I like to help people.
   I find co-workers usually come to me with questions or concerns even when I am not in a leadership role because if I do not
    know the answer, I will at least point them in the right direction. In my last two roles, I was promoted to leadership
     positions after less than a year with the company.</p>

<p>I am an excellent communicator. I take pride in myself on making sure people have the right information because it drives
   better results. Most business issues stem from poor communication, so I feel a responsibility to keep everyone on the same
    page. These skills helped to increase my personal client retention rate by more than 40 percent in a year and helped the 
    team deliver 100 percent of our projects by the original deadline.</p>
